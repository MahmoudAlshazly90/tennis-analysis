# 🎾 Tennis Ball Detection with YOLO  

This project focuses on **improving the accuracy of tennis ball detection** using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. By optimizing the training dataset, fine-tuning parameters, and enhancing preprocessing techniques, I achieved significant improvements in detection accuracy.  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
- **Model Used:** YOLO  
- **Goal:** Detect tennis balls in various challenging conditions  
- **Enhancements:** Dataset optimization, hyperparameter tuning, and improved preprocessing  
- **Applications:** Sports analytics, robotic vision, automated ball-tracking systems  

## 📈 Results  

### 🔴 Initial Detection  
Before optimization, the model had difficulty detecting tennis balls accurately in complex scenarios.

📈 Results:
Using the same YOLO model:
1️⃣ Initial Results: While the detection worked, the accuracy wasn’t consistent in complex scenarios.
2️⃣ Improved Results: After refining the training dataset and optimizing the process, I achieved much higher precision and recall, ensuring robust detection even in real-world conditions!

💡 Why This Matters:
Precise object detection is a game-changer for applications like sports analytics, robotic vision systems, and automated ball-tracking technologies.

🎯 This project reflects my dedication to pushing the boundaries of AI in sports, and I’m excited to explore more ways to innovate in this space.
